   * This number represents how far away this Operation is from the furthest "root" operation (i.e.
   * an operation with no consumers). This helps us to calculate the critical path (i.e. the
   * longest chain of projects which must be executed in order, thereby limiting execution speed
   * of the entire operation tree.
   *
   * This number is calculated via a memoized depth-first search, and when choosing the next
   * operation to execute, the operation with the highest criticalPathLength is chosen.
   *
   * Example:
   *        (0) A
   *             \
   *          (1) B     C (0)         (applications)
   *               \   /|\
   *                \ / | \
   *             (2) D  |  X (1)      (utilities)
   *                    | / \
   *                    |/   \
   *                (2) Y     Z (2)   (other utilities)
   *
   * All roots (A & C) have a criticalPathLength of 0.
   * B has a score of 1, since A depends on it.
   * D has a score of 2, since we look at the longest chain (e.g D->B->A is longer than D->C)
   * X has a score of 1, since the only package which depends on it is A
   * Z has a score of 2, since only X depends on it, and X has a score of 1
   * Y has a score of 2, since the chain Y->X->C is longer than Y->C
   *
   * The algorithm is implemented in AsyncOperationQueue.ts as calculateCriticalPathLength()
