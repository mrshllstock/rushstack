 * When using the PNPM package manager, you can use pnpmfile.js to workaround
 * dependencies that have mistakes in their package.json file.  (This feature is
 * functionally similar to Yarn's "resolutions".)
 *
 * For details, see the PNPM documentation:
 * https://pnpm.js.org/docs/en/hooks.html
 *
 * IMPORTANT: SINCE THIS FILE CONTAINS EXECUTABLE CODE, MODIFYING IT IS LIKELY TO INVALIDATE
 * ANY CACHED DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS.  After any modification to pnpmfile.js, it's recommended to run
 * "rush update --full" so that PNPM will recalculate all version selections.
